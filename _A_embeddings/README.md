Work for Towards Data Science 

Visualizations and SHAP analysis of the effects random injection of "unseen" encoding values during neural network training using a custom data generator.

Model performance data is in performance_metrics.pdf (.xlsx)

Code is at the top level; notebooks would run in order. 

##### Running Code

First, run code in the parent folder (see README.md in the parent).

Then, change A00_setup.py

  * Make temp_path point to a writeable folder in the system
  * parent_path should point to outputs from the parent folder's scripts (this is temp_path in the top-level setup)
